Abstract

   This document describes a protocol for sending Gopher requests and
   receiving Gopher responses over HTTPS.  Each Gopher request-response
   pair is mapped to an HTTPS exchange.

1.  Introduction

   This document defines a specific protocol, Gopher over HTTPS (GoH),
   for sending Gopher [RFC1436] requests, as Gopher [RFC4266] URIs, and
   receiving Gopher responses over HTTPS [RFC7540], using https
   [RFC2818] URIs (and therefore TLS [RFC8446] security for integrity
   and confidentiality).  Each Gopher request-response pair is mapped
   into an HTTPS exchange.

2.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   A server that supports this protocol is called a "GoH server" to
   differentiate it from a "Gopher server".  Similarly, a client that
   supports this protocol is called a "GoH client".

3.  HTTP and Gopher URL

   A GoH client is configured with a URI Template [RFC6570] which
   describes how to construct the URL to use for the HTTP request.
   Discovery of the URI Template is beyond the scope of this protocol.
   The single variable "url" is defined as the Gopher URI of the
   request.

   Example URI Template:

Internet-Draft                     GoH                        March 2019


   https://goh.example.com/gopher-proxy{?url}

   Given the Gopher URI of the Gopher request:

   gopher://gopher.example.com

   Results in the HTTPS request URI:

https://goh.example.com/gopher-proxy?url=gopher%3A%2F%2Fgopher.example.com

4.  The HTTP Exchange

4.1.  The HTTP Request

   A GoH client encodes a single Gopher request into an HTTP request.
   The HTTP request MUST use the GET method.  A GoH client SHOULD
   include an HTTP Accept request header field with the media type
   "application/gopher".

   Accept: application/gopher

4.2.  The HTTP Response

   A GoH server must include an HTTP Content-Type response header field
   with the media type "application/gopher" to indicate the body
   contains a Gopher response.

   Content-Type: application/gopher

   A GoH server response has the Gopher response as its body.

5.  IANA Considerations

5.1.  Registration of the "application/gopher" Media Type

   Type name: application

   Subtype name: gopher

   Required parameters: N/A

   Optional parameters: N/A

   Encoding considerations: This is either in text or binary format.
   The contents are a Gopher response as defined in RFC1436.

   Security considerations: The content is a Gopher response.  Security
   issues are not discussed in RFC1436.
